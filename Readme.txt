The program was made to kill time, as such, it may have bugs in it and will slow down your computer and bring it to its knees.

If you do want to take your life into your own hands, then I recommend you download the program
and when you run it, drag the balls of CPU lagg onto your desktop and watch your $1000+ gaming
computer beg for mercy as you overload it with a hilariously simple program.

Enjoy
